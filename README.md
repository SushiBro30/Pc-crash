# Pc-crash
A python script to crash your pc
You can use this to stress test your PC or other device that you can run python on.
Plrase don't use this for malicious purposes. If you don't listen, <br>**I'M STILL NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR ACTIONS**<br>
<br>
Also, you can change the crashing value to be greater in the code itself (clarified in the notes in the code)<br>
See how high the value you can make it without it crashing.<br>
<br>**NOTE:** This may just slow down and not crash newer PCs with better processors when using a low stress level.<br>

<br>thats all.<br>
