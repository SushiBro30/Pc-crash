# PC Crash
A Python 3 script to crash your pc
You can use this to stress test your PC or other device that you can run python on.
Please don't use this for malicious purposes. If you don't listen, <br>**I'M STILL NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR ACTIONS**<br>
<br>
## Usage
1. Copy and paste the raw data from crash.py into a compiler(reccommended) or a command line(might not work).<br>
2. Alternatively, you can download the file crash.py and run it by using the command line and typing `python3 crash.py` <br>
**Note:** put the file in the default directory (usually `c:\\Users\\XXXX` for windows [change XXXX to username]) or execute before running `cd *your*\\*file*\\*directory*\\`
##
Also, you can change the crashing value to be greater in the code itself (clarified in the notes in the code)<br>
<br>**NOTE:** This script may just slow down and not crash newer PCs with better processors when using a low stress level.<br>
## Requirements
1. Python 3.x (of course)
2. NumPy<br>
NumPy will probably be installed, but if not, use `pip install numpy`
